# Syntaxic
A syntax highlighter specifically made for Hackforums.net (and other MyBB based forums). It is based on HighlightJS and jQuery.

### How to install
First, clone this repository or just download it as a ZIP file. If you downloaded it as a zip file, unzip the file and move it to a directory of your liking (you'll have to keep it there for as long as you need to use this extension).

Open your chrome browser, click on the burger icon (or the menu as some people may call it). Click on settings, and then from the menu go to extensions. You'll see a *developer mode* checkbox, check it. You'll be presented with three new buttons. Click on *Load Unpacked Extension* and using the dialog box, select the folder where Syntaxic exists in. Horaay! You now have Syntaxic installed.

In the near future, our extension will be on the chrome web store. That would make installing Syntaxic a breeze.

### How to use
Using Syntaxic is very easy and intuitive. To change the theme, you simply click on the Syntaxic icon in yor toolbar and select your theme from the dropdown list.

To expand code blocks, you basically click on them, and using the magic of jQuery, they'll expand.

### How to update
Updating Syntaxic for the time being requires you to delete your current version, and installing the new one again. Just follow the install steps after deleting it.

### Creating your own theme
